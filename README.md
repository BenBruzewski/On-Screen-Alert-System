# On-Screen-Alert-System GUI dev branch

This branch is used to have version control for the GUI elements of OSAS.

It will demonstrate the GUI proficiency of compiling an immutable window that will allow the user to interact with the program and start the main processing unit of OSAS itself.
The main difference between this gui-dev branch and main is that this will contain only gui-related files and code whereas main will likely have the final executable.
