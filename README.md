# On-Screen-Alert-System
This is a Repo for Team 6's CPE496 Project: "On-Screen Alert System"

Developers for this project include:

Ben Bruzewski
Brendan Romanczuk
Bryce Schaefer
Robbie Cabra
Ryan Colborn
Shuchita Syema

On-Screen Alert System has two components: One for Image Recognition / Software Detection Software, and another for Mobile Notifications via Text Messages

Each component will have its own development branch and main branch. Once both parts are in a good place, the two main branches will be merged into "main" for combined testing later this semester

The Text Messaging component uses Twilio's Text Message API to deliver the message from a Twilio-provided number.
