# On-Screen-Alert-System
This is a Repo for Team 6's CPE496 Project: "On-Screen Alert System"

On-Screen Alert System has two components: One for Image Recognition / Software Detection Software, and another for Mobile Notifications via Text Messages

Each component will have its own development branch and main branch. Once both parts are in a good place, the two main branches will be merged into "main" for combined testing later this semester
