# Config file for selecting which targets to enable / detect during program execution
# Please ensure that all config names below match their respective target filenames (eg. stopsign=1 works for stopsign.png)
# Also: please ensure there are no blank lines in the file as spacers as these will end the reader early.
# Each item in the targets folder should have a config line below. If a line is missing that target WILL NOT BE TRACKED!
