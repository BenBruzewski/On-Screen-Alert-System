<REDACTED ACCT SID>
<REDACTED AUTH TOKEN>
<REDACTED PHONE NUMBER>

#place SID on first line, AUTH on second line, FROM_NUMBER on third

#Just in case that does not make sense
#This will function as long as the first three lines are
#1. Your String Identifier, found on your TWILIO account page, 34 digits starts with AC
#2. Your AUTH, 32 digits of hex from the same page. Do not publish
#3. Your Virtual Number. +1XXXXXXXXX, +1 followed by ten digits
# Twilio will sell you one for peanuts
#and nothing else
#Run userSIDAUTHcheck.py to double check, anything other than true and you need to check for stray characters in notepad++
#Or create an account on Twilio, then grab a legit SID/AUTH/FROM_NUM

#
#.env format if you're feeling clever
#TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = _SID goes here_
#TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = _AUTH goes here_
